I was told that for any application, I need a privacy policy. That sounds redicilulous for a standalone software (which is Internet-aware). But anyway, here you are.

Privacy declaration
======

This is the privacy *declaration* of Easer, 
not a Privacy *Policy*, 
because Easer is, 
a standalone software which, 
is controlled solely, 
by the user.

Easer is not so traditional, 
because it is aware of, 
the existence of, 
the Internet, 
that is, 
an internet with TCP/IP,
the most common one.

For Easer, 
Internet connection is, 
a *function*, 
not a *prerequisite*. 
Easer transmits no data, 
through the Internet, 
to anywhere, 
unless instructed by you. 
I design nothing in Easer,
that sends your data,
including crash logs,
to any server.

For control, 
it means mentally, 
not physically, 
because any program is, 
physically controlled, 
by the hardware, 
then the platform, 
then the environment, 
finally its source code, 
which you can review at any time, 
so can everyone. 
Open source, 
is not a trick, 
at least not for me.

Some must-knows
======

But of course, 
on an Operating System, 
your Android for example, 
softwares talk to dependencies. 
This is normal, 
which shall not frighten anyone, 
including me, 
so should you. 
Trust or change, 
your OS and underlying mechanisms, 
and blaming Easer won't help.

Extensions, 
or say plug-ins, 
or say remote skills, 
can extend the function of Easer, 
without including everything into Easer, 
by installing them, 
separately. 
Easer can not control, 
what is written in, 
the extensions, 
separate applications. 
But fear not, 
they are only, 
additional skills -- 
Easer will not, 
initiatively, 
send anything to them, 
unless you explicitly say so, 
except for, 
the existence of Easer.

Foreseeable potential future
=====

Receipt platform
-----

We hope to have a platform, 
which shares receipts of Easer, 
the Event, Condition, Profile and Script templates, 
so people can benefit. 
This makes a difference, 
regarding Internet connection, 
where Easer will, 
receive data from, 
and transmit data to, 
this platform, 
for the sake of, 
obtaining receipts, 
or sharing receipts. 
If that comes, 
a Privacy Policy will too come, 
for the platform, 
not for the software, 
because Easer is and will still be, 
controlled by the user.

Federated automation
------

Federated automation, 
is also a future, 
which I hope to see. 

Contrary to capitalists, 
or careerists, 
who wants their own, 
business or implementation, 
become the only, 
mega, 
platform. 
I believe in, 
unification, 
but not monopoly.
Different machines, 
computers, phones, IoTs, 
have their own, 
but also form, 
a collective, 
organic, 
automation, 
based on a shared, 
federated protocol. 

That is from, 
a traditional value of Chinese philosophy, 
which I believe is, 
rarely recognised by the westerners, 
王道, 
not 霸道.

Were it comes, 
information exchange, 
between machines, 
will be implemented. 
But still, 
no personal information, 
will be transmitted.
